# Directory Change Tracker

The project focuses on monitoring changes in directories over time by capturing snapshots upon user request. Developed in C, the program allows the user to specify the directory to be monitored as a command-line argument. It tracks changes within the specified directory and its subdirectories, updating the snapshot each time it runs by storing metadata for every directory entry.
